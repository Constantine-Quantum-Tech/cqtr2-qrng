# CQTraining 2: Quantum Computing and Quantum Random Number Generation

Welcome to the second edition of the CQTraining workshop! We are excited to have you join us at the University of SÃ©tif 1 on June 10th, 2024. This workshop is designed to review and deepen your knowledge of Quantum Computing and use it to build a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG).

## Installation

To ensure you have all the necessary tools and packages installed, please follow the instructions below:

### Using Conda
To create the environment with all required dependencies, run:
```bash
conda env create -f cqtr2.yml
```

### Directly from PyPi
Alternatively, you can install the necessary packages directly using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit[visualization] qiskit-aer qiskit-ibm-runtime --upgrade
```

### Check Installation
Check that you have everything correctly installed by running:
```bash
    python -c "import qiskit; import qiskit_aer; import qiskit_ibm_runtime; print(qiskit.__version__); print(qiskit_aer.__version__); print(qiskit_ibm_runtime.__version__)"
``` 

You should get an output that ressembles (with potentially slighly different versions):
```
1.1.0
0.14.2
0.23.0
```
